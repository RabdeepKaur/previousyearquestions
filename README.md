Studying for exams can be stressful, especially last-minute. You know the content, but writing answers that match the marks distribution is tricky — a 10-mark question doesn’t need a paragraph, and a 2-mark question shouldn’t be over-explained.

2. Structures answers perfectly according to the marks assigned, so every answer is the right length.
   
4. Keeps your own words and explanations from your notes while formatting them into a well-organized answer.
   
6. Uses OpenAI and Gemini models, switching dynamically via LangChain for the best output.

## Tech stack:

Next.js for smooth frontend & backend integration.

PostgreSQL for secure, scalable storage.
